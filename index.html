            Since I was around 8 years old, I have had a real fond place in my heart for collecting,
            playing & painting minature figurines from a table top war game called <i>Warhammer 40,000</i>.
            <br>
            The game requires players to have a certain amount of models, formed into groups called units,
            which then makes up an army that players use to play against other players on a battlefield of set proportions.
            The battlefield size is stated in the games rules.
