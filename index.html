            Since I was around 8 years old, I have had a real fond place in my heart for 
            collecting, playing & painting minature figurines from a table top war game 
            called <i>Warhammer 40,000</i>.
            <br>
            In order to play a player require a certain amount of models formed into groups 
            called units, which then makes up an army that players use to play against other
            players on a battlefield of set proportions. The battlefield size is stated in the 
            games' rules.

            Over the years I have ended up with a collection of 3 different armies that I want to
            share with you on this website's pages. I'll give a small explaination about each army and
            why I liked them enough to collect and paint them.
