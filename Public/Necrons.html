            An ancient race that fell victim to an even more ancient beings trick turned them from organic beings to souless, 
            ever living metal machines. 
            <br>

            My second collected army, the Necrons, are effectively a sci-fi undead force which combine a slow moving legion with
            some nasty agile hard hitting units all with the chance ability to rise from the dead if defeated during gameplay. 
            This was a nice way of breathing some life into the game for me as at this point I had been playing only with Space Marines
            for quite a number of years and they got a little boring with no real flavour in game play other than moving a bit then shooting,
            or mostly stationary and shooting if facing a fast moving army.
            <br>
            The Necrons brought a rich lore which I enjoyed a lot more than the Space Marines, and what I felt like was a force that could both shoot
            better and had ways of moving fast around the table top with some pretty cool rules, like rolling each turn for dead units to come back to life, 
            that differed depending on how I comprised my army. They also solved another twinge I had with the hobby at the time and that was I wasn't happy
            with the painting quality I was achieving with the Space Marines so I wanted an easy way out of not having to paint fine details. This is quite
            obvious when you take a look at the photos that they all just look like metal with not much if any painted details. Even though it could 
            be considered cheating in the eyes of other people in the hobby, I simply wanted to use the fast painting method of spray painting them black,
            then dry brushing a metal paint all over them and calling it done! Easily the fasted army I've painted to date and has also been pretty fun to play with too!           
            <br>
            <br>
            The only regret I have with this collection was it was at a time when I started running out of people to play with so I only had a game or 2 with them having spent
            a fair amount of money and time reading lore, and collecting the miniatures themselves.
